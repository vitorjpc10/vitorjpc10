### About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

Hi there! My name is Vitor Cavalcante, a seasoned Software Developer with over 2 years of professional experience. I specialize in Java, Python, AWS, GCP, and data integration.

Throughout my career, I've developed high-performance pipelines, ETL processes, and RESTful APIs using a range of tools, including Java, Scala, Python, SBT, Gradle, and Golang. I've successfully integrated data from multiple sources into AWS and GCP, resulting in improved efficiency, data availability, and targeted campaigns.

I've also refined legacy data connectors, automated data collection, and created comprehensive documentation to streamline workflows and reduce onboarding times. Additionally, I've optimized data ingestion through automation, developed robust ETL frameworks, and enabled efficient querying with AWS Athena and Google BigQuery.

My academic background in Electrical and Computer Engineering (BS, New York Institute of Technology, GPA 3.9, Summa Cum Laude) has provided a solid foundation in computer science principles and applied mathematics.

Technologies I'm proficient in include Java, Spring, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Scala, Go, Python, Git, Postman, JUnit, JSON, YAML, SBT, Gradle, SQL, JavaScript, Spring Cloud, HTML5, CSS3, React, Docker, and BigQuery.

I'm fluent in English and Portuguese, with intermediate proficiency in Spanish. Outside of work, I enjoy audio engineering, music, cooking, and exploring different cuisines, truly a chef at heart.
